# Capstone Project - The Battle of the Neighborhoods (Week 1)

## <a name="intro"></a>Introduction / Business Problem

Bicycling is popular in the Raleigh NC. There are many popular greenway trails near Raleigh, but finding a good bicycle shop with easy access to a neighborhood is a challenge. This project is to help a group of stakeholders who want to open a bicycle shop in an ideal Raleigh NC location. They are passionate about serving a community with their shop, and their previous experience shows that a bicycle shop in a high density areas draws much of their business from within the neighborhood on bike or on foot.

They want to learn about existing bicycle shops in the Raleigh area and which neighborhoods have the highest density per square mile.  They want to focus inside the inner beltline of Raleigh. There are several universities and colleges in this area, and there are also high population area with apartments and condominiums. This project will pull information on existing bicycle shops to understand where the competition is already open. The project will provide insights into the Raleigh neighborhood populations per square mile to give insights on which neighborhoods have larger customer bases as well as the median income per household to support a location plan.


## <a name="data"></a>Data

This project will use the Foursquare data on bicycle shops in the central Raleigh NC area. It will also use Foursquare to locate the colleges and universities in the area to give evidence of extra school related populations that could form part of the customer base.

It will also use neighborhood data accumulated from City-Data.com which provides neighborhood information on population density and median household income. The shareholders believe that most of their customers will use their bicycles for recreational purpose, but as an added bonus, we will look at the percent of population that uses a bicycle as their means of transportation to get to work based.  

Neighborhood data is seen in this example of one Raleigh neighborhood: https://www.city-data.com/neighborhood/Glenwood-South-Raleigh-NC.html.  Since the dataset is not readily available in downloadable format, we will scrape the pertinent information needed from the webpages of each neighborhood of interest.

Here is an example of the population density data:

Using the data found with Foursquare and the neighborhood population, we will recommend a great location for a bike shop.
